# The primary point of this workflow is to ensure that the developer experience is good.
# We take a very vanilla ubuntu image, install all necessary dependencies via "normal" means,
# and then run the build and test steps as described in the README.md file.

# The artifacts produced by these builds are not intended to be used for anything other than
# ensuring that the developer experience is good.

# Production artifacts are produced in a sterile environment (in another CI workflow).
